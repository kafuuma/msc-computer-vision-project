# Project Proposal: Multi-Class Image Classification Using Feature Extraction and Machine Learning

## 1. Title  
**Comparative Analysis of Feature Extraction Techniques and Machine Learning Classifiers for Multi-Class Image Classification**

## 2. Introduction  
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications in object recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous systems. While deep learning (e.g., CNNs) has dominated recent research, traditional machine learning methods with handcrafted features remain relevant for interpretability and computational efficiency.

This project explores the effectiveness of different feature extraction techniques—**3D color histograms, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**—combined with classical classifiers (**Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines**) for classifying images across **20 distinct classes**.

## 3. Objectives  
1. Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand dataset characteristics  
2. Extract and analyze **handcrafted features** (color, texture, shape) for discriminative power  
3. Train and optimize **multiple classifiers** using **five-fold cross-validation** and **randomized grid search**  
4. Evaluate model performance and determine the **best feature-classifier combinations**  
5. Compare results against **baseline CNN performance** (if time permits)  

## 4. Methodology  

### 4.1 Dataset & Preprocessing  
- Use a publicly available dataset (e.g., **Caltech-101, CIFAR-100 subset, or custom dataset**)  
- Perform **train-test split (80-20)** and apply **normalization/scaling**  

### 4.2 Feature Extraction  
- **3D Color Histograms**: Capture RGB/HSV distributions (8×8×8 bins)  
- **HOG**: Extract edge orientations (parameters: 9 orientations, 8×8 cells)  
- **SIFT**: Detect keypoints and encode descriptors (clustered via Bag-of-Words)  

### 4.3 Classifiers & Optimization  
- **Logistic Regression** (One-vs-Rest)  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors** (Euclidean distance, optimal *k*)  
- **Decision Trees & Random Forest** (Feature importance analysis)  
- **Support Vector Machines** (RBF/linear kernel, tuned C & γ)  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** via **randomized grid search** with **5-fold CV**  

### 4.4 Evaluation Metrics  
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score**  
- **Confusion Matrix** (identify misclassified pairs)  
- **t-SNE/PCA** for feature space visualization  

## 5. Expected Outcomes  
1. Identification of the **most discriminative features** for different classes  
2. Optimal **feature-classifier pairings** (e.g., HOG + SVM for texture-rich images)  
3. Performance benchmarks for traditional ML vs. CNNs (if included)  
4. Insights into **computational trade-offs** (speed vs. accuracy)  

## 6. Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (OpenCV, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Feature Extraction**: OpenCV (HOG, SIFT), scikit-image (Color Histograms)  
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)  
- **Visualization**: t-SNE, PCA, Confusion Matrix plots

## 8. Potential Challenges & Mitigation  
- **Class Imbalance**: Use SMOTE or class-weighted loss  
- **High Dimensionality**: Apply PCA for feature reduction  
- **Computational Cost**: Use cloud resources (Google Colab)  

## 9. Conclusion  
This project will systematically evaluate traditional feature-based image classification methods, providing insights into their strengths and limitations. The results will serve as a foundation for future work on hybrid (handcrafted + deep learning) approaches.
